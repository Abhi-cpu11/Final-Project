          <h2>Transitioning from Player to Coach</h2>
          <p>
            In Grade 8 at HGI, I was one of the lower-level players. I was
            getting minutes but not making much of an impact. Over the summer, I
            put in serious work and came back a completely different player. By
            Grade 9, not only was I performing at a high level, but I also
            started stepping into a leadership role. I began drawing up plays
            that worked almost every time. I could read the game and sense when
            it was the right moment to run a certain action or shift the
            defense. That’s when I started thinking like a coach, even though I
            was still a player.

          <h2>Student of the Game</h2>
          <p>
            Even when I was playing, I spent more time studying the game than
            most people around me. After practice, I would go home and watch NBA
            or college games, not just for fun, but to actually learn something.
            I would pause the video, rewind plays, and break down the small
            things. I looked at how defenders rotated when they were off the
            ball, how timing affected spacing, or how a jab step could shift the
            entire defense. Watching film became a habit, and it changed how I
            saw the game. That mindset shaped the way I played. I was never out
            there just running around or sticking to a script. I tried to make
            sense of what was happening in real time and react with purpose. Now
            as a coach, I want my players to see the game the same way. I don’t
            just teach plays or moves. I teach the meaning behind them. I want
            my team or players to know when to adjust, when to read the defense,
            and why every detail matters.
